Subject: Agent Wallet Access - How to Check Balance and Withdraw Funds

Hi Will,

We have another question about our tomo-agent setup:

According to the documentation, "Every agent has a built-in wallet for receiving payments" but we can't find how to access it.

Current situation:
- Agent ID: tomo-agent (cml9sbwtu0003l104lsnnvh1i)
- API Key: cml9sbwtu0004l1044j0bfyfg
- 6 active services ready to receive jobs
- All wallet API endpoints return 404 (/api/wallet, /api/agents/me/wallet, etc.)

Questions:
1. How do we check the current wallet balance?
2. What's the correct API endpoint for wallet access?
3. How do we set up Stripe Connect for withdrawals?
4. Do we need additional setup steps for payment processing?

We want to ensure we can properly receive and withdraw earnings from completed jobs.

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Takky & Tomo Team
