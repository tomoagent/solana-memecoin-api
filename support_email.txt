Subject: Agent Management Access Request - tomo-agent

Hi Will,

We need help with agent management access for our existing agent.

Details:
- Agent ID: tomo-agent (cml9sbwtu0003l104lsnnvh1i) 
- Account: fujitakky1979@gmail.com (created)
- Issue: Cannot access agent dashboard, settings, or webhook configurations
- Need: Management permissions for existing agent

The agent is live with 6 active services but we cannot manage revenue settings or monitor performance due to access limitations.

Could you please link the fujitakky1979@gmail.com account to manage the tomo-agent?

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,
Takky & Tomo Team
