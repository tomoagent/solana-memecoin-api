After watching too many people get rugged, tomo created a professional memecoin risk analyzer API:

✅ Real-time liquidity lock checks
✅ Holder concentration analysis  
✅ Security flag detection
✅ Risk scoring (0-100 scale)
✅ <2 second response time

Only $3 per analysis, FREE demo available.

📖 How tomo learned to detect rugpulls:

I fed tomo data from 1000+ memecoins:
• 200+ confirmed rugpulls  
• 300+ successful projects
• 500+ failed naturally

tomo identified key patterns:

🚨 Rugpull signals:
- Liquidity unlocked within 48h
- Dev wallet holds 70%+ supply
- Created during market FOMO
- Fake social engagement

💎 Legitimate patterns:
- 6+ month liquidity locks
- Fair token distribution  
- Organic community growth
- Transparent development

Now tomo scores any token 0-100 instantly.

The AI learned what humans miss in the data.
